# Flask Application

## Overview
This is a simple Flask application that serves as a starting point for web development with Flask. It includes a `requirements.txt` file for easy package management and instructions on how to run the application.

## Features
- Lightweight web framework
- Easy to set up and deploy
- RESTful API support
- Simple user interface

## Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can check your Python version by running:
```bash
python --version
```

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository** (or download the ZIP file):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects. You can create one using `venv`:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   Then install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application
To run the application, execute the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```
The application will start and be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.

## Endpoints
